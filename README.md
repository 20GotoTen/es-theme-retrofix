Retrofix - Emulationstation theme for Batocera 5.25+
====================================================

Theme designed by 20Goto10
Version 2.0
First release 31/05/2020
Last updated 16/03/2023


**Retrofix combines two of my loves: vintage video game artwork and Batocera. Sometimes the game art
can be more interesting than the games themselves, so you don't need any games to enjoy Retrofix,
you can add dummy .zip files into the games directories, then scrape, you have a visual
reference library.**

Scraping images for Retrofix:
-----------------------------

The theme relies on the following assets being scraped, and it ALL can be done
directly in Batocera, no external scraper required!

 - Thumbnail
 - Marquee
 - Image
 - Video (optional, worth it if you have the disk space)

**Don't use Scraped image mixes. They will look terrible with this theme.**



SETTINGS
--------


Gamelist view styles to try:
----------------------------

- **TILES (default):** The default layout. Like Netflix or Prime for retro games! Each game pulls in a thumbnail, Marquee and plays a video clip of the selected game in the background. If no video is scraped, it will show the thumbnail.

- **DETAILED:** A nice balance of speed and visual niceties. Plays the selected video in the background, alongside the game marquee and game overview. Supported by a left-side gamelist.

- **DETAILED BOXART:** As above, but with a slightly tweaked layout to to accommodate box art.

- **GRID:** Displays boxes automatically in a two row configuration. Will be refined in a later update.

- **BOXES:** Game box art configured for each system, which is nice if you love box art / Japanese variations like me. The grids have been autoconfigured for the format of each system's box art, so it's recommended to keep the grid set to AUTO.


Main Menu / System views video delay:
----------------------

If you've scraped videos, Retrofix will display these as backgrounds across the system and gamelist views. Here you can determine if and when they show.

- **2 Seconds (default):** The scraped image will be replaced by the scraped video after 2 seconds.
- **5 Seconds:** The scraped image will be replaced by the scraped video after 5 seconds.
- **Video off:** Only the scraped image will show.


System logos:
-------------

- **mix:** Uses the theme default (my preferred mix). This is the theme default.
- **eu:** Uses European logos if available.z
- **jp:** Uses Japanese logos if available.
- **us:** Uses US logos if available.


Batocera logo:
--------------

- **Show logo:** Shows the Batocera logo across all menu screens.
- **Hide logo:** Shows the Batocera logo across all menu screens.

Animations:
-----------

To users of lower-powered devices such as the Raspberry Pi, you may want to turn off animations for a speedier experience.

- **Animations on:** Turn on the animations (theme default).
- **Animations off:** Turn off the animations.


Scanlines:
-----------

Display a scanline overlay over the screenshots and videos displayed in individual system views.

- **No scanlines:** Don't show scanlines (theme default).
- **Light scanlines:** Show light scanlines over images and videos in individual system views.
- **Dark scanlines:** Show darker scanlines over images and videos in individual system views.



Button set:
-----------

Here you can choose what button style you want to see throughout Retrofix. By default, where available, it will display the button styles for each system selected, including a supporting colour palette.

- **Unique (default):** Uses a button style specific to the system (default, recommended)
- **Red/Blue/Black/Cyan/Green/Yellow buttons:** Uses a generic button style in your chosen colour across Retrofix.
- **<system name>:** When selected Retrofix will use that button style across all of your systems.


Primary / Secondary button graphic:
-----------------------------------

Retrofix uses a custom help system (english at v2 launch) that allows you to set the theme to the specific buttons you set when you configured your controller. That way, the button graphics in Retrofix match your configuation (either A, B, X or Y).


UI modes:
---------

- **Grey mode (default):** Uses a dark grey system-wide colour setting.
- **Darker mode:** Uses a darker system-wide colour setting.
